# Horiseon Home Page

## Description 

The Horiseon home page identifies and gives an overview of the services offered, and how these service would benefit potential clients. As such, it's important for the webpage itself to be SEO-friendly to not only make the site more discoverable in search results, but also to demonstrate to potential clients the customer-facing experience we can provide to them.

However, the webpage in its original state had a few issues that would be a detriment to its goals, namely misused H tags, as well as a lack of specific HTML tags (header, footer, section, etc). In addition, the "Social Media Marketing" link, which was intended to bring the user to the appropriate section on the page did not function. 

To remedy these issues, I changed the following:
- H tags were changed so that company name at the top of the page was the only H1 element on the page, the titles of each topic in both the "content" and "benefits" sections were all changed to H2 as needed, and the H tag in the footer was changed to H3.
- As appropriate, several div tags were changed to more pertinant tags, specifically header, nav, section, article, and footer. 
- The "social-media-marketing" class applied to the 3rd article in the "content" section was changed to an ID to fix the broken "Social Media Marketing" link.
- The opportunity was also taken to improve organization, and eliminate redundancy, in the style.css file. Specfic styling, especially styling that was repeated in the code, was changed to apply more generally. Also, the contents of the file was reorganized to match the order of elements in the HTML to make the file more efficient to navigate and modify in the future.
